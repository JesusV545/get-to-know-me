You'll want to hire after viewing this professional portfolio.

In this project, I have created my very first portfolio with the use of HTML and CSS. More specifically, I deliberately used unique CSS properties such as Flexbox, Media Queries, and CSS variables. 

The importance of this project was specifically to provide myself with a good foundation to work off on and continuously improve while my skills, as a striving full stack web developer, are sharpened and honed.
